===========================

Creating the net
=================

To add a node, click on the display and either select the add node button or press “a” on the keyboard.

To delete a node, click inside it, press the delete node button or press “d” on the keyboard.

Nodes can be moved around by left clicking and dragging inside a node.

A node can also be resized by left clicking and dragging inside the small box in the corner
(this is for when there is more information that we would want to store/display for each node.)

To connect two nodes, right click inside the start node and drag to the end node.
To delete a connection repeat the same process.

The display can be zoomed with a mouse wheel and re-centred by left clicking and dragging outside a node box.

To observe a node, select it and either right click inside it, press “o” on the keyboard or press the observe node button.

Populating a node.
===================

To populate a node either select edit node or double click inside a node. States can be added with the insert state button.
To delete a state, select the edit box of the state to delete before pressing the “delete state” button. Probabilities of all the states (columns) should add up to one.

If a node has parent nodes, with undefined states, it will not be possible to define the probabilities.

Node colour coding.
===================

A red box has undefined states.
A Black and red box has defined states but an undefined population.
A purple and black node is being observed.
